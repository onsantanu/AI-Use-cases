# Natural Language to SQL Query Generator

This project is a Python program designed to translate everyday English questions into SQL database queries. It's a step towards making databases more accessible to users who aren't familiar with SQL.

## How it Works (The Simple Idea)

The program uses basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and sentence similarity to understand your question and convert it into a query your database can understand. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1.  **Find Important Words:** The program first tries to pick out the key pieces of information from your question (like names of things you're looking for, specific values, or actions like "count" or "show total").
2.  **Understand the Connections:** It then tries to figure out how these pieces relate to each other and to the known structure of your database (which tables and columns to use). This step uses sentence similarity to compare your question to a set of example questions it has been "trained" on.
3.  **Build the SQL Query:** Finally, based on the understanding from the previous steps, it constructs the actual SQL query.

## Core Technologies

* **Python:** The main programming language used.
* **spaCy:** A library for Natural Language Processing, used here for tasks like identifying parts of speech and named entities (like dates, locations, etc.).
* **Sentence Transformers:** A library used to calculate how similar sentences are to each other, helping match your question to known patterns.
* **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations, often in conjunction with sentence similarity scores.

## Getting Started

*(You would add instructions here on how to set up and run your code, for example:*

1.  *Clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/onsantanu/AI-Use-cases`*
2.  *Go to the respective folder. `cd AI-Use-cases/text_to_sql`*
2.  *Install the required Python libraries: `pip install spacy sentence-transformers numpy torch`*
3.  *Download the spaCy model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`*
4.  *Run the main script: `python your_main_script_name.py`)*

## Current Status & Future Ideas

This project is a foundational exploration into NL-to-SQL translation. Future improvements could include:

* Handling more complex questions and SQL features (like advanced joins, subqueries).
* Improving the accuracy of entity recognition and relationship mapping.
* Allowing connection to live databases.
* Training on a larger and more diverse dataset of questions.
